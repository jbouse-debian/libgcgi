Description:
-----------
	GCGI is a library that implements NCSA's common gateway interface (CGI) 
as well as extensions to that interface as defined in RFC2388.

Installation:
------------
	Unpack the gcgi-0.9.5.tar.gz:
	
	$ tar xvfz gcgi-0.9.5.tar.gz
	$ cd gcgi-0.9.5

	Configure the gcgi library:

	$ ./configure

	To build GCGI with encryption support, run configure like this:

	$ ./configure --with-openssl

	Build the gcgi library:

	$ make

	This should create the static library file, libgcgi.a in the src directory.

	If you want to make the library available to the rest of the system:

	$ su
	# make install
	
	Otherwise, copy the library (src/libgcgi.a) and the gcgi.h header file somewhere convienent.  
	For the following example, the library and header were copied into the same 
	directory as the program being built against it.
	First compile your program and then link against GCGI like this:

	$ gcc -g -Wall -c example-prog.c
	$ gcc -g -Wall -o example-prog -L. example-prog.o -lgcgi -lm

	and if you built with OpenSSL, link like this:

	$ gcc -g -Wall -o example-prog -L. example-prog.o -lgcgi -lm -lssl -lcrypto

	A set of example programs will also be built in the examples/ directory.
	There are example HTML forms in the examples subdirectory to use with the example programs.  
	These should give you a good idea how to use GCGI's funtions. The examples do the following:

		gcgiFormTest -- An example of a vanilla CGI program that fetches data from an HTML
		 		form. Use this program with the formexample.html file.

		gcgiFileUploadTest -- An example of how to upload files with GCGI.  Use this program
				      with the fileupload.html file.

		gcgiCookieTest -- An example of how to use regular and encrypted cookies with GCGI.
				  Use this program with the cookietest.html file.

		gcgiGetInput -- A small utility program that will capture the input to a CGI program.
				This is useful when debugging with GCGI. Use this program to capture
				the incoming POST data and use it along with the gcgiDebug() method in GCGI
				to run a program in a debugger or from the command line. It was used to 
				capture the POST data files included in the examples directory.
